# ThemeParkMangement

In my package, I created an 
imitation of an online portal of a theme park. The 
program gives the user many options to choose in the 
home page. The user can view the types and names of 
different rides and the restaurants in the parks. The user 
can view the resorts owned by the theme park and the 
restaurants available there. The user can also book the 
entry tickets for the park or book rooms in resorts 
according to their needs. The user can view all the prior 
information regarding the online bookings. The theme 
park also provides membership cards. Membership 
offers the customers various offers and plans for their
customers. The user can apply for the membership by 
giving the necessary details in the membership form.
